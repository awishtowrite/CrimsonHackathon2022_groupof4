<h3> <b> Why Is Studying a Main Element to Consider? </b> </h3>
<p> If you look online, many ‘experts’ will tell you that you should be studying 2-3 hours for every hour that you are in class. Therefore, a student with 15 credit hours should study at LEAST 15 hours a week. However, one study suggested that the average college student studies only 10-13 hours a week which is less than 2 hours a day.</p>
<p> All students are in this school to learn and get a degree. But we know that achieving those goals can be challenging no matter the major. So, being able to get the help necessary is a major step toward this academic success because no student in WSU wants to get a degree with bad grades. There are many resources available for any student to not struggle alone. </p>
<br/>

<h3> <b>  Study Techniques</b> </h3>
<p> There are many ways to approach studying, that can make you a more effective learner and reduce the stress of a heavy workload. </p>
<p> <i>- Pomodoro Technique: </i> Studies have shown that people can only stay concentrated for certain lengths of time.
  With this study method, you study for 25 minutes and then take a five-minute break.
  After repeating this four times, take a 20-30 minutes break. This will help you avoid burnout while studying. </p>
</p> <i>- List of Three: </i> Often times you can have a long list of tasks that you need to do that seem too overwhelming to complete.
 Choose just three things to focus on, or break up one task into three parts.
 Only focus on completing these three tasks before doing any of your other tasks.
 A list of three things can seem a lot more manageable than a long list. </p>
<br/>

 <h3> <b> Practical techniques to follow:</b> </h3>
 <p>- Check around for study programs at your college </p>
<p>- Study with a study buddy and meet up at least once a week </p>
<p>- Write things down on paper/ notebook, instead of typing </p>
<p>- Use the whiteboard to practice and study </p>
<p>- Take your notes in blue, studies have shown it improves memory recall </p>
